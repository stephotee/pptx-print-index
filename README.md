This is a simple script that will retrieve information about a PowerPoint template, specifically the index values for placeholder in slide layouts. 
This is can useful when working with Steve Canny's python-pptx library where you need to retrieve index values for a slide layout.

Here's an article I wrote that incorporates this script, specifically with regards to retrieving the index value for chart placeholders in a slides layout template.
